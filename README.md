# What I Learned

This app helped me learn a lot about andriod developement, mainly just how to implement the libraries in java to do what I 
wanted them to. I also learned how to commit files to github (so when the files get corrupts and want to sTOP WORKING FOR SOME 
REASON, I can just get the last version and not have to complETELY RESTART FIVE TIMES. (I'm a little salty about that.)). I also learned 
aobut XML coding, which was a big part of the design functionality of the app, and kept track of the resources available (because it 
yELLED AT ME EVERYTIME I TRIED TO HARDCODE SOMETHING LIKE NO YOU CAN'T DO THAT.) I also learned about debugging because that's very important. 
I learned a lot more, but its kinda just the type of thing that's like, "Oh, this is important but I don't know what it is, but that's how 
I do this spefic task." ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
